## What is this?

Anatome turns muscle groups and exercise names into clean, colourable anatomical SVG diagrams
over a plain HTTP API, and speaks the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
so an assistant can use it as a tool with no integration work at all.

- 🔓 **No API key.** No signup, no token, no header. Every example below runs as written.
- 🎨 Multi-colour layered muscle rendering, `<img src>`-friendly via `?output=raw`
- 💪 873 exercises, searchable and resolvable to muscle layers, with hosted demo GIFs
- 🤖 MCP server (10 tools, 31 when signed in) + OpenAPI 3.1 spec
- 📓 Log meals, workouts, supplements and body weight by talking — then **search** it: by
  exercise, by date range, by text. `get_exercise_history` answers "is my bench going anywhere?"
- 🔗 Shareable dashboards with charts, for showing a coach — expiring, revocable, no login
- ☁️ Runs on Cloudflare and nothing else — see [SELF_HOSTING.md](./SELF_HOSTING.md)

## Connect it to an assistant

**Claude** — Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector → paste:

```
https://api.anatome.dev/mcp
```

**ChatGPT** — Settings → Apps → Create app → same URL. Pick *OAuth* if you want logging, *None* for catalog-only.

**Config file** —

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "anatome": { "type": "http", "url": "https://api.anatome.dev/mcp" }
  }
}
```

Then just ask: *"which muscles does a Bulgarian split squat actually work?"*

## Optionally, log to it

Signing in adds meals, water, workouts and body weight. It is OAuth 2.1 with PKCE — your client
registers itself, a browser opens, you enter an email and password, and that is the whole setup.
There is still no key.

> *"Set my timezone to Europe/Warsaw."*
> *"I had oatmeal with berries for breakfast, about 420 calories."*
> *"Log 3×5 bench press at 100kg."* · *"Took my creatine."*
> *"How am I doing today?"* · *"Is my bench going anywhere?"*
> *"Show me every session with deadlifts since March."*
> *"Share my last month with my coach."* → a link with charts, expiring in 24h

**Anatome does no food lookup and calls no model** — your assistant estimates the macros and
sends them, and Anatome stores and adds them up. That is what keeps this tier free.

Your data is yours: `export_my_data` and `delete_my_account` are tools, and the same buttons are
on `/account`. See [PRIVACY.md](./PRIVACY.md) — including the one real gap, that there is no
password reset because Anatome sends no email.

## Use the HTTP API

```bash
# Generate a muscle diagram (raw SVG)
curl "https://api.anatome.dev/generateImage?layers=DC2626:chest,abs&view=front&output=raw"

# Search exercises
curl "https://api.anatome.dev/searchExercises?q=bench&limit=5"

# Exercise demo GIF
curl "https://api.anatome.dev/exerciseGif?id=Bench_Press" -o bench.gif
```

Embed directly in HTML — no auth header to attach, so a bare `<img>` tag works:

```html
<img src="https://api.anatome.dev/generateImage?gender=male&view=dual&layers=DC2626:chest|F59E0B:triceps&output=raw" alt="chest and triceps" />
```

## Fair use

Free, with a budget of **50 requests per caller per day**, resetting at 00:00 UTC. Loopback and
private addresses are never counted, so local development is unlimited. Static catalog reads
(`/listMuscles`, `/listEquipment`, `/bodyPaths`, `/openapi`, the guide endpoints) are edge-cached
and not counted either.

"Per caller" is your **account** once you sign in, and otherwise your MCP session or your IP.
Only the account is durable: a remote connector reaches this API from the assistant vendor's
egress addresses, shared by every user of that assistant, so an anonymous budget is an
approximation. Signing in gives you one of your own.

Running out returns `429` with a body a program can act on:

```json
{
  "error": "daily_fair_use_limit_reached",
  "limit": 50, "used": 50, "remaining": 0,
  "reset_at": "2026-08-08T00:00:00.000Z",
  "retry_after_seconds": 62678,
  "retryable": false
}
```

The MCP endpoint is deliberately different. `initialize` and `tools/list` are **never** rate
limited — otherwise a user who is simply out of requests for the day cannot complete the
handshake, and every assistant renders that as *"connector failed"*. Only `tools/call` spends
budget, and when it runs out the call returns a normal result with `isError: true` and a
plain-English explanation, so the model tells the user the truth rather than reporting an outage.

Need more? Either [self-host it](./SELF_HOSTING.md) and set your own limit, or use the hosted
platform at [platform.anatome.dev](https://platform.anatome.dev), which adds per-user workouts
and meals, AI parsing, interactive widgets, curated programming, coach and trainee accounts and
production quotas.

## Repository layout

| Path | What | Deploys via |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`api/`](./api) | Cloudflare Worker at **api.anatome.dev** (Hono + TypeScript) | `wrangler deploy` |
| repo root (`src/`, `index.html`, `vite.config.js`, …) | React/Vite site + playground at **anatome.dev** | `npm run build && wrangler deploy` |
| [`docs/`](./docs) | Working notes and audits | — |

Two independent deployables, no shared runtime. The site needs no backend at all; the API needs a
D1 database **only** for accounts, and serves the whole catalog without one.

## Development

```bash
# API
cd api && pnpm install && pnpm run worker:dev     # → http://localhost:8787
cd api && pnpm run db:migrate:local               # only if you want accounts locally
cd api && pnpm test                               # 257 tests, plain node
cd api && pnpm run test:workers                   # 106 tests inside workerd, real local D1
cd api && pnpm run typecheck

# Site
npm install && npm run dev
npm run lint && npm run build
```

Point the site at a local Worker with `VITE_PUBLIC_API=http://localhost:8787 npm run dev`.
